# Installation and build instructions 

## Requirements:
- CMake
- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Icerider007/OpenGLBasics.git 
cd OpenGLBasics 
mkdir out 
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja
```

This should create an application that you can run.
I am a complete noob to this, so lmk if this doesn't work
